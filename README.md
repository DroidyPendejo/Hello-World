# Hello-World
This world is stupid, yet full of butts. Many people have butts. Some are plump and round, while others are tiny and somewhat flat. It is not butts that make us great, but butts that make us unique. Yes, every butt is different and every butt is special.
My butt is a smelly butt, and has a left and right butt cheek. Sometimes my butt makes farty sounds and releases a stinky gas, known as farts.
Farts are not uncommon amoung butts.
